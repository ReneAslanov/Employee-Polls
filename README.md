# Employee Polls Project

This is my version of the final frontend project using React and Redux.

Employee polls is a web application that is used to create polls, which can then be answered by team-members to simplify the decision-making process. Each poll consists of two options.

In order for this application to work you need Node-JS on your local machine

You need to `npm install` and `npm start` to launch the project

Running the tests is possible with `npm test`

    - Username: name-property from user in users object (utils/_data.js)
    - Password: corresponding password property in users object
